  <p class="center">I've always had an interest in code because of its puzzle like nature. In high school I took any avaible classes dealing with the
  subject. Computer Programming to Drafting was a blast during my high school days and only made me want more. Its only a few connected dots to see why I would end up at the Montana Code School. I'm excited to see what the months hold.
  More to Come
